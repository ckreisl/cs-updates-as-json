But both maps are still available in Casual, Deathmatch, and Competitive modes.\n\nWe're also making some adjustments to weapons. The AWP has had its magazine size reduced to five bullets (so make them count!), and the M4A1-S now does less damage at long ranges. \n\nTry the changes out and let us know what you think!\n\nAnd thanks for the blog post title, Ryan on Twitter (@Schaffurr)!",

Congratulations to the winners!\n\n[h3]Maps[/h3]\nYou've been patient, and it's finally here. Tuscan is available in all game modes, so jump in to this classic map and put it through its paces!\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/3381077/afed74f51e74df7dec80aab66eb3d7c463be39b5.png[/img]\n\nAnd that's not all: we've brought back Anubis and Breach to competitive matchmaking, and added Primetime and Blagai to Wingman!\n\n[h3]Cake![/h3]\nIt wouldn't be a birthday without some cake... specifically, a cupcake topped with a birthday coin! For the next week (until Monday, August 22nd), CS:GO players with Prime status can grab their birthday coin by earning enough XP for their first in-game drop of the week.\n\nTen years. It's a big number, yet CS:GO is stronger than ever. Over the past 12 months alone, we've seen more players than ever before (averaging over 20 million monthly unique players), record viewership for Majors (2.7m concurrent viewers), and massive community support with over $70 million raised for professional organizations, teams, and players. The future could not look brighter.\n\nHappy Birthday, CS:GO.",

Join us for the next two weeks as 24 teams battle for their share of a $2,000,000 prize pool and the chance to be crowned CS:GO\u2019s next Major Champion!\n\nThere\u2019s still time to support your favorite teams at the Major by picking up a Viewer Pass or some team stickers and patches. And don\u2019t forget to make your picks in the Pick\u2019Em challenge before the first matches begin!\n\nIt\u2019s been a while, so here\u2019s a quick recap on how the Majors work:\n\nFirst, teams are sorted through Regional Major Ranking events, and the number of teams invited from each region depends on how well that region performed in the last Major. The top 8 ranked teams are invited as Legends, the next 8 as Challengers, and the last 8 as Contenders.\n\nThen, the Major begins with the \u2018Challengers\u2019 stage where Challengers and Contenders compete in a Swiss format (three wins and you move on, three losses and you\u2019re eliminated).\n\nNext is the \u2018Legends\u2019 stage, where Legends face off against the top 8 from the prior stage, again in a Swiss format.\n\nFinally, the top 8 teams reach the Playoffs, a single-elimination bracket where the winner takes all!",

Each of the 10 winning entries will earn $100,000. Beyond submitting your original weapon finish to the CS:GO Workshop, all you need to enter is a non-limited Steam account. And yes, teams of more than one person can also enter. \n\nTo help content creators get a better feel for what we\u2019re looking for we\u2019ve launched a [url=https://counter-strike.net/dreams]dedicated web site for the contest[/url]. Here you will find more info on the types of finishes we\u2019re looking for, examples of the Dreams & Nightmares theme, info on how to enter, details of the contest, and more. We've also [url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/730/discussions/2/]created a sub forum in CS:GO's Discussions[/url] for artists, technical artists, and others to collaborate on contest-themed submissions and ideas.\n\nWe launched the Workshop on Steam almost 10 years ago in the hopes of creating a centralized hub for community created content. Since then, over five million content creators have submitted and published over 20 million new items for a variety of games on Steam, making them available to millions of gamers around the world. And, as everyone who plays these games knows \u2013 including CS players \u2013 many of the most iconic in-game items, maps, and more have been authored by members of the community. The Dreams & Nightmares Content Contest is designed to help further support this community. \n\nIf you have any questions or comments about the contest, please email us at csgoteamfeedback (at) valvesoftware (dot) com using the subject \u201cDreams & Nightmares.\u201d\n\nGet started today; submissions are due October 21, 2021!",

We see new players entering CS:GO all the time, and it\u2019s as important as ever that anyone in the world can pick up and play the game for free.\n\nAlong with all the gameplay that we made available for free, new players had access to drops, Ranks, Skill Groups, and a free path to Prime matchmaking. Unfortunately, over time, those benefits have become an incentive for bad actors to hurt the experience of both new and existing players. So today we\u2019re revising the offering for new players.\n\nNew players can still play every game mode, play on community servers, and play workshop maps. However, they will no longer receive XP, Ranks, drops, or Skill Groups; those features are now exclusively available to Prime Status players.\n\nNew players can still upgrade to Prime by purchasing the Prime Status Upgrade from the Steam store, however there is no longer a free path to Prime. And if you purchase the upgrade in the next two weeks, your current Skill Group and XP progress will carry over.\n\n[h2]Introducing \u2018Unranked\u2019[/h2]\nWhen new players play Competitive, Wingman, and Danger Zone, their matches will still use skill-based matchmaking, but players will not earn a Skill Group.\n\nPrime players can also play Unranked matches, where their Skill Group will not be affected and where there are no lobby Skill Group restrictions.\n\nWhether you\u2019re a seasoned veteran or a new arrival, GL and HF!\n\nToday's release notes can be found below.\n\n[h2]Release Notes for 6/3/2021[/h2]\n[ NON-PRIME ]\n[list]\n[*] Non-Prime status accounts will no longer earn XP, Ranks, Skill Groups, item drops, or Prime status through play time.\n[*] Non-Prime accounts will not be able to participate in Ranked matches.\n[*] Non-Prime accounts will not be able to activate Bonus Rank XP items and can no longer claim Service Medals.\n[/list]\n[ UNRANKED MATCHES ]\n[list]\n[*] Introducing Unranked matches for Competitive, Wingman, and Danger Zone game modes.\n[*] While still formed using skill-based matchmaking, Unranked matches do not affect Skill Group and have no Skill Group party restrictions.\n[*] Non-Prime accounts are restricted to Unranked, whereas Prime accounts may choose between Ranked and Unranked.\n[*] Ranked matches will always be with other Prime players, exclusively, whereas Unranked matches will be created from the mixed pool of Non-Prime players and Prime players that have chosen to play Unranked.\n[/list]\n[ VSCRIPT ]\n[list]\n[*] Added \"DebugDrawBoxAngles\" to draw oriented bounding boxes. Usage: DebugDrawBoxAngles( ent.GetOrigin(), ent.GetBoundingMins(), ent.GetBoundingMaxs(), ent.GetAngles(), r, g, b, a, time);\n[*] Added \"GetBoundingMinsOriented\" and \"GetBoundingMaxsOriented\" functions that return the axis-aligned bounding box of an entity taking its current orientation into account.\n[/list]\n[ MISC ]\n[list]\n[*] Scrimmage has been removed from Competitive matchmaking, and has been replaced by Unranked matchmaking.\n[*] Added Import button to Workshop Workbench that takes a .tga file and generates a .vtf file. If the .tga file name contains \"_normal\" the generated .vtf file will be compiled with the 'normal' flag.\n[/list]",

These guidelines had not seen an update since the game was new and all CS:GO VAC bans were relatively recent. But VAC bans can now be more than 8 years old. So we\u2019ve decided to update them.\n\nMoving forward, a VAC ban will only disqualify a player from an event if it was either received less than 5 years prior, or if it was received at any time after their first participation in a Valve-sponsored event (e.g., after participating in a qualifier for an RMR event). Note that VAC bans stay in place with all of their other effects; the only change is how they influence your eligibility to play in Valve-sponsored events.\n\nThere are other reasons a player may not be eligible to participate in Valve-sponsored events. These remain unchanged.\n\nWe hope you\u2019re as excited as we are for the upcoming 2021 RMR events. Stay tuned for more information as we head toward the Stockholm Major this Fall!",

Ultimately there would be no Major in 2020, but it is important that fans have an opportunity to celebrate and recognize the hard work of the best teams of 2020. So we\u2019re excited to announce 2020 CS:GO RMR Capsules.\n\nThese capsules represent the teams that would have received invitations to the 2020 Fall Major, broken down by their invitation status (Legend, Challenger, Contender). You can find the final RMR scores and standings [url=https://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/2020-eu-rmr-standings/]here[/url].\n\nFor these stickers, 50% of the proceeds directly support the teams.\n\n[b]2021 RMR Events[/b]\nWe will continue to hold regional RMR events to identify the 24 teams to invite to the 2021 PGL Stockholm Major. In the link below you can find all the details and updates to the 2021 RMR event system, but here are some highlights:\n[list]\n[*] RMR points are reset for 2021, however the 2020 RMR Legends will start with 600, Challengers with 300, and contenders with 100 points.\n[*] Teams can now specify a substitute player (any player who is not registered to participate or substitute for another team) that is separate from their coach.\n[*] A team incurs a penalty when they substitute out a player in an event, but there is no penalty when that player is brought back in.\n[*] During online matches only players are allowed in the room and on the server. Neither coaches nor any other team staff will be allowed in the room, on the server, or to otherwise communicate with the team during an online match.\n[*] The full details of the 2021 RMR system can be found [url=https://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/csgo-regional-major-rankings-for-2021/]here[/url].\n[/list]\n[b]Coaching Integrity[/b]\nIn September of 2020 we were alerted to the fact that many professional coaches were exploiting a coaching-feature bug to gain an unfair advantage during matches. You can read about our initial response [url=https://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/2020/09/31604/]here[/url].\n\nSince then, ESIC has published the findings of their investigation and the resulting sanctions. You can read about them [url=https://esic.gg/esports-integrity-commission-findings-from-investigation-into-csgo-spectator-bug-exploitation/]here[/url].\n\nAs our follow up, we have decided that coaches that exploited the camera bug will be ineligible to participate in some number of future Valve-sponsored events\u2013that number to be determined by the extent of the abuse.\n\nThe following table translates ESIC demerits into Major ineligibility:\n\nESIC Demerits \u2014 Number of Majors to Miss\n[list]\n[*] 2 Demerits \u2014 1 Event\n[*] 3 Demerits \u2014 2 Events\n[*] 4 Demerits \u2014 3 Events\n[*] 5 Demerits \u2014 5 Events\n[*] 6+ Demerits \u2014 All Events\n[/list]\nIn addition to consequences for individuals, we have also thought about how commonly coaches exploited the bug, for how long it went unreported, as well as how common coach stream-sniping accusations have been.\n\nTo avoid the diminished integrity of coaching from casting a shadow on the integrity of Valve-sponsored events, we\u2019ll be changing the restrictions on support staff in the following way:\n\n[i]During online matches only players are allowed in the room and on the server. Neither coaches nor any other team staff will be allowed in the room, on the server, or to otherwise communicate with the team during an online match.[/i]\n\nFinally, today's Release Notes can be found [url=https://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/2021/01/32671/]here[/url].",

The theme will be \u201cCounter-Strike\u201d itself, including all things CS-related, from the original Counter-Strike mod to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. The weapon finish and sticker designs may be created in any style. We will need weapons for all tiers to complete the case, from Mil-Spec to Covert; consider this when designing your weapon finishes. All designs must be original with the exception of Counter-Strike logos or icons.\n\nTo help sort these themed submissions, please tag them with \"CS20\" in the title of your submission to the workshop (e.g. CS20 | Finish Name). All previous submissions are eligible for the event. Just make sure to tag them so we can find them more easily.\n\nAll submissions for this event must be completed and submitted to the workshop by September 19th 2019. The Weapon Case and Sticker Capsule will be released at a later date, after we have chosen which submissions will be included. All items submitted for this event will still be eligible for future releases.\n\nWe have also released a new style guide to help with weapon finish creation, and hopefully answer any questions you may have about the process. The guide can be found [url=http://counter-strike.net/workshop/workshopstyleguide]here[/url].",

            "body": "With today\u2019s Steam update, we\u2019re making a change to the Workshop submission process to address fake item scams. First-time submissions to the CS:GO workshop will now require email verification before the item can be listed publicly. For those of you that have previously submitted Workshop items, you shouldn't see any change in functionality. \r\n\r\n[h1]Background[/h1]\r\nWhat do we mean by fake item scams? If you browse the Workshop enough, you may have come across an item with an image of a rare skin, promising giveaways or free content. These items often contain phishing links that are used to compromise Steam accounts.\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/3381077/ebd6f7494eda176115d017bd821427b7dcc91491.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nIn the past, our moderation team would review Workshop items reported by players. Fake item scams would then be deleted and our team would reach out to the owner of the account and let them know that their account is likely compromised. The problem with this approach was that some items went unreported for quite a while, allowing them to appear to players and get in the way of real submissions.\r\n\r\n[h1]New Process[/h1]\r\nWith today's update, Steam will send an email to the account owner when a new item is posted for the first time, asking them to review and confirm the item they just posted. If an item was posted without their knowledge, this email provides an easy path to recover the account and change their password.\r\n\r\nOur aim with this change is to reduce the potential for scams on the Steam platform, without creating unnecessary hassle for frequent Workshop creators. \r\n\r\nLet us know if you have feedback.",

For example, when requesting playtime for the day on July 4th at 09:00:00 GMT, the aggregated data returned will be for the 24 hour period between July 3rd 00:00:01 GMT and July 3rd 23:59:59 GMT.

            "body": "The quality of workshop submissions has been steadily increasing.  We\u2019ve seen some incredible work by new and returning contributors. For the next case, in order to direct this amazing creative force in the most useful direction, we\u2019ve decided to announce in advance the weapons we hope to ship.\r\n\r\nShipping a case means balancing an ideal case design against the available weapons on the workshop. Often we\u2019d like to ship a particular weapon at a particular quality, but can\u2019t find a match on the workshop.  As a result we end up shipping some weapons more frequently than we\u2019d like, and some a lot less.\r\n\r\nWhile we expect to ship several of the items already on the workshop, we\u2019re hoping this announcement can help guide artists to fill some gaps (marked with an asterisk below). Note that the list isn\u2019t a guarantee of the final case design.   With that caveat out of the way, here is the list:\r\n\r\nCovert\r\n[list]\r\n    [*]M4A1-S\r\n    [*]G3SG1*\r\n[/list]\r\nClassified\r\n[list]\r\n    [*]USP-S\r\n    [*]AK-47\r\n    [*]SSG 08*\r\n[/list]\r\nRestricted\r\n[list]\r\n    [*]M249*\r\n    [*]P250\r\n    [*]MAG-7*\r\n    [*]Galil AR*\r\n[/list]\r\nMil-Spec\r\n[list]\r\n  [*]Glock-18\r\n  [*]Dual Berettas*\r\n  [*]FAMAS*\r\n  [*]SCAR-20*\r\n  [*]XM1014*\r\n  [*]MP7*\r\n  [*]MAC-10\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nWe will be making our final selections after September 7th.\r\n\r\n[b]FAQ[/b]\r\n\r\n[b]Do I need to do anything special to be eligible for this case?[/b]\r\nNo, all you have to do is submit your designs by September 7th and make sure your item has been finalized on the workshop.\r\n\r\n[b]Do I need to use the new paint style in my design?[/b]\r\nNo, it\u2019s just one more option that you can consider. As with any weapon case, we\u2019ll be looking for variety in art style.\r\n\r\n[b]Do I get paid more for a weapon in a higher tier?[/b]\r\nNo. Every weapon in a case pays out an equal share.\r\n\r\n[b]How do I design for a specific tier?[/b]\r\nIt mainly has to do with visual salience and design specificity.  Weapons with bright colors and designs that perfectly complement a weapon\u2019s geometry end up in the upper tiers.  Weapons with more subdued colors and/or more randomization in the pattern application end up in the lower tiers.\r\n\r\n[b]What can I do to stand out?[/b]\r\nGive your weapon a story. This is more than creating a beautiful design; it\u2019s giving the weapon a visible history that hints at a larger narrative. Good examples are the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=194005009] AWP | Asiimov[/url], the[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=318047669] P250 | Cartel[/url],  [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=330837804]AK-47 | Wasteland Rebel[/url], and the  [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=388283991]P90 | Elite Build[/url].\r\n",

            "updatetime": 1599602319,
            "body": "As we consider what will be included in the next big Operation, we wanted to talk a bit about community made maps and how they are selected.\r\n\r\nThe CS:GO workshop community has generated a ton of custom made maps of increasingly high quality. We're currently in our fourth Operation, and so far Operations have featured a total of 21 unique community made maps. On average, each community map has earned over $23,000, per Operation it was featured in.\r\n\r\nDeciding which maps are included in an Operation involves much consideration of several distinct criteria. Every map is considered and evaluated on its own individual merits. The final decision is made by carefully weighing each of the following contributing factors:\r\n\r\n[h1]Theme / Aesthetic Quality[/h1] \r\nMaps should succeed at bringing players into the game by presenting an attractive and visually appealing space. Strong aesthetic quality should make players happy to spend time in the map, independent of gameplay considerations. This criteria may include a cohesive theme for the map, or a consistent style that helps players fulfill a fantasy. A good-looking map with a high level of polish that matches the quality of the official maps is a requirement, but a map with an interesting or unique core theme with spaces that feel like a real place, is of significant value. Our goal is not to dismiss any map out of hand, but rather to ensure that Operations include great-looking maps with consistent aesthetic quality.\r\n \r\n[h1]Gameplay / Fun / Retention[/h1] \r\nIf great visuals bring players in, great gameplay gets them to stay. When players are challenged or are having fun on a map, they will choose to play on the map over and over again. This is called Player Retention and is achieved by creating a map that is balanced, has lots of opportunities for a player/team to learn new strategies, develop new skills or have fun, new experiences. Ideally we want CS:GO\u2019s maps to enjoy extended popularity due to strong gameplay even after the initial fantasy has waned. This will ensure that a map will stick around and keep players happy for a long time.  Maps that don\u2019t objectively meet these criteria will score poorly in this area. \r\n \r\n[h1]Playtime / Interest[/h1] \r\nCommunity play time for workshop maps is a primary driving factor for determining map popularity, but community interest also plays a factor.  Interest is a combination of a bunch of components including workshop ratings and community discussion, but (if applicable) we value how many people are currently playing a map and how much they play it as the most important factor in this category. The Playtime / Interest category is considered a wildcard category for us and will multiply the value of the first two categories, but can't make up for a map that scores very low in them. \r\n \r\nMaps that excel in all three categories have a higher likelihood of being included in an Operation.  \r\n\r\n[u][i][b]FAQ[/b][/i][/u]\r\n[u][b]My map wasn\u2019t selected for this Operation, is it possible it\u2019ll make it into a future operation?[/b][/u]\r\nYes. If a map meets the bar on the criteria above, but did not get selected, it is still eligible to be included in future operations. \r\n \r\n[u][b]Will my map be considered for an Operation if it is not uploaded to the workshop?[/b][/u]\r\nNo. Maps need to be on the CS:GO workshop to be considered in an Operation. Additionally, they need to be in a \u201cshippable\u201d state before Valve make the map picks for the upcoming Operation. Ideally, the map has also been played a bunch by the community and has gone through a lot of rounds of feedback and iteration.\r\n\r\n[u][b]But if it meets the bar and was submitted to the workshop on time, why wasn't it selected?[/b][/u]\r\nWhen the group of maps are selected for an Operation, the maps are selected so that they work as a collection. Our goal is to provide a collection of strong maps that have good gameplay variety and unique visuals that appeal to different groups of people. If your map meets the bar, but wasn't selected, it may have not fit well with the group selected and will be considered next time.\r\n \r\n[u][b]How important is \u201ctheme\u201d in a map?[/b][/u]\r\nWe consider theme to be very important. We tend to see a lot of maps that all have similar themes (warehouses, generic industrial, generic factories, etc) or maps that tend to heavily share themes with maps we\u2019ve already shipped. Creating a map with a unique theme will help your map stand out to the community and will increase your chances of getting noticed/selected.\r\n \r\n[u][b]Will non-Classic (arms race, demolition etc.) maps ever be included in an Operation?[/b][/u]\r\nThere are a lot of great non-Classic maps on the Workshop and we\u2019re working on ways to include them in future Operations while still generating enough revenue for the map authors, but for now, we\u2019re only including maps that support Classic modes. \r\n \r\n[u][b]What\u2019s more important: New and novel features or tried and true familiar gameplay?[/b][/u]\r\nThe short answer is that they are both equally important and different types players will value them differently. Players who have been playing for a long time have built up a lot of skills and expectations and playing a map that feels \u201cfamiliar\u201d to them is very important. But on the other hand, there are a lot of players who value new experiences which they can share with their friends and have fun. Producing a map that is both new and incorporates familiar things from classic maps is a good goal when producing a map.",

            "body": "The CS:GO workshop community constantly amazes us with weapon finishes and stickers of increasingly high quality. We have currently shipped over 70 weapon submissions made by the community and all together, CS:GO weapon finish creators have earned over $3 million, with each finish earning over $40,000 on average. \r\n \r\nSince shipping the first community case, we've gathered and responded to a variety of contributor questions. Common questions include \"how do I get my submission in a case?\", and \"what can I do better to get my work noticed?\". These are useful questions to answer for all contributors, so we've outlined our answers in the form of contributor tips below:\r\n \r\nTips for Contributors\r\n[list] \r\n[*][b] Submit only high quality designs that were made by you.[/b] The entirety of the submission must be your creation; no clip art. It must be original content and if the work is the result of collaboration then every contributor must be listed in the contributor revenue share. The designs that you submit must be of high quality in execution.  Showing your process is a great way to stand out and demonstrate the quality and originality of your work.\r\n \r\n[*][b]For weapon finishes, consider making finishes for weapons that have few high quality submissions.[/b]  Some weapons don\u2019t have a lot of high quality finishes submitted for them (Duel Berettas and Negev for example).  Making high quality original finishes for those weapons is great way to stand out and increase you chances of making it into a case. Keep in mind each item in a case gets an equal share of the revenue.\r\n \r\n[*][b]Vary the techniques, themes and finish types, and try to experiment with new ones.[/b] When putting together cases and capsules we look for items that vary in technique and theme. Technique is the type of artwork that is used. Graphic patterns and hand painted designs are examples of different techniques. Example for themes would be finishes that look Sci-fi or Military. If you are making finishes for a particular weapon you may want to make one with a technique or theme that is under-represented, or hasn't been attempted yet.  Certain types of finishes are also underrepresented in the workshop.  In particular finishes that allow for flexibility in the way a pattern is applied to a weapon. These offer players a chance to get a unique version of a weapon finish.\r\n\r\n[*][b]Don't fixate on bold designs. Cases and capsules also contain designs that vary in saturation and contrast.[/b] Currently on the workshop we see many high contrast highly saturated designs. These designs can be identified from a distance but equally important are designs that are subtle enough to only be noticed when held, as different players have different preferences when it comes to broadcasting their weapon finish choice.  Try making designs that vary in saturation and contrast.  Sometimes making a subtle design is actually harder than a bold one.  \r\n \r\n[*][b]Don't forget about popularity.[/b] Getting your finish upvoted and noticed is a great way to demonstrate desirability and collect feedback that will help you iterate on it. One of the factors we use to gauge community interest is the popularity of a submission.\r\n[/list] \r\nHopefully this information is helpful when you are making decisions on what to work on.  We look forward to seeing even more amazing work from the CS:GO Community.",

            "body": "Recently we received a DMCA takedown notice regarding copyright infringement with respect to the the M4A4 | Howl, and a community sticker, Howling Dawn, claiming that the artwork was not originally created by the stated contributors. This matter is extremely serious, and we have taken appropriate action to resolve it. \r\n\r\nWhen we launched the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse/?appid=730&section=mtxitems]CS:GO Items Workshop[/url], our goal was to provide artists with a space to share their creative ideas. By design, the Items Workshop has very low friction for artists to submit their work \u2013 new contributions do not require Valve review or approval. To ensure that these contributions represent original content, we require that all Workshop contributors sign a [url=http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/workshoplegalagreement/?appid=730]legal agreement[/url] confirming that their contributions are original. We also enable the community to monitor Workshop submissions and identify copies and plagiarism via the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/games/SteamWorkshop/announcements/detail/1225221890776210801]report flag[/url].\r\n\r\nAll contributors share joint responsibility for the originality of their Workshop submission, and therefore share joint liability for claims of copyright infringement. That is, if two or more artists collaborate on a submission and the submission contains intellectual property that isn\u2019t their own, all artists involved in the submission will share in the consequences.  \r\n\r\nFor the items in question, the following steps have been taken:\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Both contributors have received Steam Community bans. They receive no proceeds from either item, and both items have been removed from the game. \r\n[*]For owners of the M4A4 | Howl and Howling Dawn sticker, those items have been replaced by an alternative designed by the CS:GO team. These items will never be produced again, and have been assigned the \u2018Contraband\u2019 rarity.\r\n[*]All other in-game items that involve at least one of the contributors in their revenue share have been discontinued. \r\n[*]The Huntsman Case and Community Sticker Capsule have been revised to replace the copied and discontinued items.\r\n[*]Moving forward, we will no longer work with the contributors and we will not ship any existing Workshop submission that credits their involvement.\r\n[/list]\r\nThe cost for everyone involved in the resolution of this issue has been significant, including our players and community members. It takes considerable time and effort for the CS:GO team to resolve copyright infringement disputes, but fortunately copying is rare \u2013 the CS:GO community has submitted tens of thousands of unique entries to the Workshop, and we have shipped dozens of your designs without a problem. \r\n\r\nTo ensure that we don\u2019t have issues in the future, we need your help. Please only contribute original work. If you see any items that appear to violate the Workshop copyright policy, please direct the copyright owner to tell us via Valve\u2019s [url=https://steamcommunity.com/dmca/create/]DMCA takedown[/url] page. Together we can keep the Workshop a safe place for artists and their hard work.\r\n",
