This update offers Arsenal Demolition, Arms Race, and Classic Competitive game modes.  The map cycle groups include: - All Classic Maps - Arms Race Maps - Demolition Maps\u2022 De_nuke - Fixed bot nav behavior outside locker room and near bombsite A.\u2022 Cs_office - Fixed hostage bots getting stuck behind the couch. - Fixed bots getting stuck on the roof of the dumpster.\u2022 Cs_italy - Fixed vines penetrating door frame at T Start. - Fixed building floating in skybox at Balcony. - Fixed missing geometry in arches and wall in Market. - Fixed curved pipe and square wall edge creating black area at Left Alley. - Fixed a gap in the floor at Left Alley. - Fixed texture mismatch at Market. - Fixed unnecessary collision on curb at CT Spawn Zone. - Fixed being able to see out of the playable map at Market. - Fixed not being able to jump while standing on potted plant at CT Start. - Fixed small gap in street at Left Alley. - Fixed brightly lit area at window near hostage room and T Start.Gameplay:\u2022 Added additional camera punch effect to weapon firing to give more visual feedback.\u2022 Added convar to support buying two flashbangs (ammo_grenade_limit_flashbang).

This restores the old 0.5 second latency that existing in CS for defusing, but also maintains the newer preferred ability to stop defusing without the player being inexplicably stuck for up to 0.5 seconds. This also greatly reduces the chance that small lag/packet loss events will result in the defuse being interrupted.\u2022 Reduced the size of the hostage hitboxes.\u2022 Changed the ducking speed to match the unducking speed.

        "entry": "\r\n\t\tGameplay\u2022 Bot difficulty has been adjusted.  They should be a bit easier now.Dedicated Servers:\u2022 Added support for overriding values in gamemodes.txt via gamemodes_server.txt - See csgo/gamemodes_server.txt.example for instructions on how to modify it and define your own map groups.\u2022 Added support for map sidecar files, which allow mappers to distribute map-specific gamemodes.txt variables in a separate file.  - See csgo/maps/de_dust_se.kv as an example. \u2022 Fixed mp_timelimit not working properly when mp_maxrounds was set to 0.UI\u2022 net_graph has several changes that will allow players to better see values they (or the server operator) have configured incorrectly.   - The most important difference is that the game tick rate is now shown in the bottom left, which is where \u201csv:\u201d (server fps) used to be. Server fps is not really a useful metric for players except when it is below the tick rate (indicating the server is overloaded). Server FPS above the tick rate is meaningless.  - The cl_updaterate and cl_cmdrate rate are now labeled as \u201cup:\u201d and \u201ccmd:\u201d, respectively. There is now color coding added to some of the values to indicate out of band values. If cmdrate or updaterate are set above the tick rate (requires a server operator to override the sv_maxcmdrate and sv_maxupdaterate), these values are shown in red. For optimal play experience, these values should match the server tick rate, which is the default behavior unless a server operator has overridden convars.  - Fixed formatting so that the right aligned values are correctly aligned and text doesn\u2019t shift and jump as displayed values change. \u2022 A banner element has been added to the Match Scoreboard to better convey Win, Lose, and Draw match results.\u2022 Hint text has been added to the bottom of the Loading screen.  \u2022 Updated the Armor icon next to the Armor meter to include the Helmet when purchased.\u2022 Updated the dominated/dominating/revenge icons for freeze panel, mini-scoreboard, and death notices.\u2022 Updates to the Arms Race UI:  - Now when someone reaches the Gold Knife level, the HUD shows a message in the chat text, displays an alert, and plays a sound effect.  - The scoreboard now displays the winner of the Arms Race match.  - The Arms Race weapon progression HUD element in the lower right now properly displays the data for the person you are spectating.  \u2022 In Casual and Competitive modes, the weapon inventory in the lower right of the HUD displays the spectated player\u2019s information now.\u2022 Voting UI updates:  - Fixed the panel going away right after you cast a vote or saw a vote be cast as a client.  - The vote panel has been made smaller and positioned so it doesn't cover other UI elements.  - After you cast a vote, the game no longer shows the text instructing you to press F1/F2 to vote.  - The Vote to Surrender option has been removed.  Voting to Restart serves the same purpose.   - When an attempt to vote fails because it had already failed recently, the error message is now more descriptive about what's going on.  - If a player casts a vote when another vote is already in progress, they get a message letting them know.  - If there are no players or maps that can be voted on when you try to cast a vote, those categories are disabled in the UI.  - The vote panel now animates.  - Added the proper sounds to the voting events.  - A fix was made to a vote you cast in a single player game automatically failing.  - Fixed the map you are currently playing displaying in the vote UI as \"undefined\".  - Updated the size, look and translucency of the vote panel.  - Added the ability to change the next map in the map list which overrides the next map in the mapgroup.  - Changed the text, \"Restart the map?\" to \"Restart the match?\"  - Voting for the same map you are playing as the next map will extend it and just restart the map instead of loading.  - Fixed voting panel displaying during the freeze cam screenshot.  - Fixed votes for a certain category failing if they had failed previously but had a different subcategory (for example, a vote failed for kicking player A wouldn't let anyone vote to kick player B)\u2022 Added a slider to the options menus that allow user to see and edit the numeric value directly.\u2022 Removed the Random mapgroup choice from multiplayer Find a Game screen.\u2022 Various improvements have been made to the loading screen to improve the layout.\u2022 Changed the default bot difficulty option in the Offline with Bots screen to be \"Easy\" instead of \"No Bots\".Maps\u2022 Shoots  - Fixed some vphysics console error spew by turning off collision on static props that don't have or don't need collision.\u2022 Baggage  - Moved some fill lights out a bit from the wall to reduce highlight intensity.  - Fixed some prop fading glitches.\u2022 Dust  - Adjusted the Buy Zone edges to make sure all of the spawn points are completely inside the zones now.  - Set static props with no physics hull to non-solid.\u2022 Dust 2  - Added clip brush to a crate at B that fixes an issue with the player getting stuck and dying.  - Fixed the misaligned Humvee windows near CT spawn.\u2022 Inferno  - Adjusted the Buy Zone edges to make sure all of the spawn points are completely inside the zones now.  - Fixed some red console spew with static props without physics. \u2022 Train  - Fixed a spawn point at T spawn that was intersecting a pillar.\u2022 Lake  - Fixed a number of lighting issues.\u2022 Office  - Fixed an error message regarding the slide show projection.\u2022 Safehouse  - Fixed hard to see into entry way from back porch on the T side.  - The bush prop is now placed against the wall on the T side of the house.    - Fixed a hole that went through to the skybox creating a bright blue spot under the CT side porch next to the stairs.\u2022 St Marc  - Removed certain phys props.  - Fixed a number of bad fade distances for cover props.  - Turned some phys props to static props.  - Fixed some bad fades on overlays.  - Fixed z-fighting in fence.\u2022 Nuke  - Moved the forklift and added clip brushes to prevent collision issues.  - Added clips to the blue beams in lobby room.\u2022 Sugarcane  - Turned a number of phys props to static.  - Deleted certain phys props.  - Fixed a few bad fade distances.Audio\u2022 Fix for the ding sound not playing consistently when a new weapon is earned in Arms Race.\u2022 Updated the bomb planting sounds.\u2022 Updated the helmet hit sounds.\u2022 Adjusted hostage pain reaction voice overs.Effects\u2022 Some minor optimizations to the explosion effects that may help sorting a little bit.\u2022 A few more minor optimizations for the explosions.Bug Fixes\u2022 Fixed a bug in initializing a dedicated server. \u2022 Fixed a bug with the \u2018Expert Marksman\u2019 achievement. \u2022 Fixed the \u2018Primer\u2019 achievement not awarding properly.\u2022 Adjusted the weapon achievements award criteria to more suitable kill counts.\u2022 Changed Game Mode based achievement restrictions. All achievements can now be earned in Arms Race game mode and Arms Race-specific achievements are restricted in other game modes.\u2022 Fixed \u2018Cold War\u2019 achievement only being awarded to the Terrorist team.\u2022 Fixed \u2018Wild Gooseman\u2019 Chase achievement.\u2022 Fixed incorrect description for \u2018Street Fighter\u2019 achievement.\u2022 Fixed \u2018Dead Shepherd\u2019 achievement not getting awarded.\u2022 Fix for spectating your killer by default after freezecam/deathcam \u2013 camera will now follow a controllable bot first if applicable.\u2022 Fixed 'Magic Bullet' achievement.\u2022 Felicitous Fun Fact Fixes  - Fixed \"A former player\" shown occasionally.  - Adjusted requirements for many fun facts so they no longer show when inappropriate (e.g. \"most kills with 1 kills\")  - Tweaked parameters in order to provide more interesting funfacts.  - Require team elimination for fun facts mentioning eliminating the enemy team.\u2022 Fixed a case where a bot damages a victim and then a player takes over that bot and kills the victim and the death message shows the bot controlling player as the assister and the killer.\u2022 Fix for the hitch just before the Gold Knife kill in Arms Race matches.\u2022 Removed the display of the crosshair when the C4 is equipped. \u2022 Fixed error in grenade throw angle calculation.\u2022 Fixed main menu medals disappearing after returning to menu from a game.\u2022 Fix for losing mouse cursor after joining a game with Community server browser.\u2022 Fixed crashes/errors related to more than 10 players.\u2022 Fixed a bug where the taser had no reticule.\u2022 Fixed a rare crash in the weapon selection UI.\u2022 Fixed some weapons in the UI not showing properly when you were the first player to join a server and it immediately restarted.\u2022 Fixed not being able to pick up the C4 if you have a grenade in your inventory.\u2022 Fix for the defuse kit icon displaying on the HUD of a T.\u2022 Fixed the Warmup panel showing \u2018%s1\u2019 at the start of a match.\u2022 Fixed medal ranks on the scoreboard not going away in a player slot when that bot or player has left the game.\u2022 Fixed the \"next weapon\" element showing if you were spectating at the end of a round in a non-Arms Race match.\t\t\n"

        "entry": "\r\n\t\tGameplay:\u2022 Update to bot aiming system. Players should see a substantial decrease in the ability of bots to get perfect shots on moving targets, especially at lower difficulty levels. Bots now can react poorly (or well) to enemies that are dodging/strafing, and also must now account for their own movement while shooting.\u2022 Moved the setting of maxplayer from maps to modes in gamemodes.txt.\u2022 Increased Casual money rewards, per Beta feedback.\u2022 The difficulty of the upper tier bots has been increased.\u2022 Updating movement values to community vetted numbers.

This was inspired by community feedback that suggested more towards-the-viewer recoil and less vertical recoil.\u2022 Added some recoil to the SSG08 rifle viewmodel firing animation.\u2022 Updated the 3rd person CT firing pose for SSG08. This fixes major shoulder and elbow popping, minor forearm popping on transition between firing and idle while crouched.\u2022 Updated the following viewmodel firing animations: -- Berettas -- AK-47 -- M4A4 -- Desert Eagle -- Galil ARUI:\u2022 Added full screen windowed mode to video options.\u2022 Removed Quick Match from the Play Menu.\u2022 Updates have been made to the Vote UI: -- The vote thumbs and counts now also display on the vote result, so you get a summary of why it passed or failed. -- Now when a vote fails because it was cast recently, we show that warning message before we would show the failure for an individual voter recently casting a failed vote. -- Fixed the result numbers sometimes not showing the very last vote that caused it to succeed or fail. -- The player list is now scrollable when there are more than 10 selectable players. -- Added a new convar - \"sv_arms_race_vote_to_restart_disallowed_after\" that should be set to the weapon level after which no restart match vote will be accepted.  This convar is currently set in GameModes.txt for each of the modes of play, and is set so that a vote to restart will work until someone reaches the knife level.\u2022 Updated the text for the Loading screen hints.\u2022 Updated weapon grind achievement descriptions to match their new values.\u2022 Now when you drop a weapon voluntarily, a message pops up letting you know it was dropped.\u2022 A message stating you cannot drop an item will now display when you try to drop non-droppable items.\u2022 Armor and helmet icons have been updated.\u2022 Updated the hit area for menu buttons that prevents the buttons from flickering between up and over states when cursor is near the left edge of the button.\u2022 Updates have been made to the Warmup panel: -- The Warmup panel never comes up if it doesn't have a value to fill out the number. -- The Warmup panel now properly clears when the UI clears it, so it knows to come back up again when necessary.\u2022 Offline with

is in (previously it wouldn't dim if for example, you were also dominating that player and they were dead) -- Updated the Vote panel UI to use checkbox/x iconography instead of the thumbs up/down. -- The radar maps were updated for the SE versions of Aztec, Dust 2 and Nuke. -- The Terrorist Buy Zone indicator on the radar image for Dust2 and Dust2 SE has been updated. -- The opening upfront movie art has been updated. -- Added a Join Game Button to the Play With Friends Lobby. -- Increased the font size on Vote result panel. -- Brightened the player outline in the Mini-Scoreboard.  -- The

the bomb zone area graphic indicators on the radar map. -- Added collision at the bombsite to prevent bomb falling into a crack in the geometry. -- Fixed some terrain seams near bomb site B. -- The planking on scaffolding has been moved so it is no longer a navigation hazard. A physics clip has been added to the upper planks to prevent bomb from being trapped there. -- The Nav mesh has been updated. -- Clipped off microledge on T side of double doors.\u2022 Shoots -- Adjusted collision to allow players to jump cleanly thru windows. -- Clipped the space behind sandbags on center platform.\u2022 Baggage -- Moved spawn points back against wall to help prevent spawn camping. -- Allowed for random spawning between all 20 possible spawn locations. -- Removed a floating bottle prop.\u2022 Dust -- Fixed a tight collision spot above the van in the tunnel. -- Updated the pillar model.\u2022 Dust 2 -- \"Tunnel Stairs\" is now \u201cLong Doors\u201d -- Refined Radar Map Bomb sites A and B image locators. -- Fixed a collision problem at the scaffolding by bombsite A.  -- Updated the pillar model. -- Extended fade distance on mid-barrels to prevent double door snipers from seeing through them. Thanks, VeryGames.\u2022 Bank -- Players can now crouch jump through the drive thru window of the bank building. -- Bullet decals now work on the interior surfaces of the safe.\u2022 Inferno -- Fixed a bug where a tree was growing out of a trash pile texture near Logs. -- Fixed a bug where a Bot with the bomb is unable to get out of the fountain at bombsite B. \u2022 Italy -- Tuned the Nav mesh. Fixed several jump-over-fence issues and the big issue with bots not navigating down from the hostage balcony. -- Changed Italy wine pallet collision type to cardboard.\u2022 Office -- Fixed the harsh lighting glitch in Garage near Back Way. -- Fixed the Bots getting stuck when traveling over counter tops. -- Moved the ashtray back into a corner which should fix an issue with the hostages getting stuck when exiting the building.\u2022 Nuke -- Updated the language on the radiation warning signs. Changed 'radioactiv' to 'radioaktiv!' and 'Kein Zutritt' to 'Kein Zutritt!' -- Updated the Forklift prop.\u2022 Train -- Fixed some missing ladder Nav areas to help bots climb up on ends of flatcars. -- Added new ladders to sides of bombsite train cars, adjusted biohazard straps to not be in the way of the middle of the cars. The bomb should now be plantable and defusable in the middle of each car.\u2022 Shorttrain -- Cleaned up Nav mesh. Deleted orphan areas, fixed bad jumps, fixed stale Nav mesh over missing geometry, and made tops of trains \"avoid\" areas. -- Fixed a bomb placement bug on shorttrain.  -- Added ladders to the middle of each side of the flatcars, added ladder markup, and moved struts out of the way.  -- Fixed weird geometry that was floating in mid-air on the flatcar model.Audio:\u2022 New Voice Overs added for Terrorist and Counter-Terrorist units.\u2022 Fixed the looping ambience for Lake. \u2022 Players grabbing a hostage, planting a bomb, defusing a bomb, and players close to a bomb that is about to explode now all say something over the radio informing their team of what's happening.\u2022 Player now brags over the radio when he's dominating someone.\u2022 Players now cheers over the radio when the win scoreboard is up when the match is won by his team.\u2022 Fixed a bug in the exponential panning mode.\u2022 Added snd_headphone_pan_mode and snd_speaker_pan_mode convars that specify using 0 = exponential, 1 = equal power, 2 = GoldSrc (trigonometric) for both headphone and speaker monitoring situations. This differentiation is important for setting system defaults and we may even consider differentiating surround circumstances as the speaker positioning does.\u2022 Split front/rear speaker position options for stereo versus surround. In CS:GO, stereo speaker configurations are going to want the broadest range of positional data, whereas surround systems should default to 45 degree corners, which gives both resolution and sensitivity. Adding these was largely so we can supply the best default settings possible.\u2022 Default panning method is now based (again) on an exponential curve but with an adjusted 1.22 exponent. This not only makes for less inter-speaker blurring but was determined to be the flattest xfade response in decibel level testing. Equal power remains as an option.\u2022 New convar options have reasonable doc strings.\u2022 Added snd_speaker/headphone_pan_radial_weight, which applies the \"GldSrc\" stil cosine weighting but weighted by this float convar. this allows for 1.6 style side weighting but with the exponential center weight allowed by exponential mode.\u2022 Removed all dsp from first person weapon sounds.\u2022 Added burn damage sound entry start operator to block subsequent damage sound for 1.0 seconds.\u2022 Crossfade from \"near\" gunfire to \"distant\" gunfire is now smooth, fixing the bug wherein distant sounds first got quieter then louder the further they were from the listener -- Added exponential function to the \"near\" / \"distant\" crossfade operators. -- \"distant\" weapon fire mix group has been increased significantly to offset the reduction in decibel levels.\u2022 Added \"pow\" function to math operator to facilitate non-linear crossfades in operator stacks.\u2022 Added a parameter that discounts \"player sound\" status when determining the distance of a sound that is currently hardcoded into the operators system (\"source 1\" legacy).. \"force_not_player_sound\"\u2022 Changed all of the new sounds spatialization options to use the following denial test if(sv.IsActive() && !sv_cheats.GetBool()) -- This prevents players from changing their settings during a non-cheat enabled game but allows them to tweak them during a cheat enabled game.\u2022 Fixed a bug that was always playing the AK47 sounds from the same location\u2022 Famas - lengthened sound to smooth the 3 shot burst\u2022 Small edit to the ak47_shoot, rate at beginning of wave lengthened and pitch slightly lowered in this area as well.\u2022 Re-authored the footsteps to increase clarity and remove mush, they are also louder and now more distinct within the world.Effects\u2022 Fixed a bug with the weapon shell eject effect. The highest-quality level of the effect (which usually accounted for the first three shots fired in a sequence) was using some complicated stuff for the shell bounce that was inadvertently sending the shell flying off in wrong directions at high velocities. The bug was observed on the AUG (rifle shell), but was also present on several other types of shell ejects.\u2022 A bunch of hit impact effects have had some of their previous POW restored.\u2022 Blood impacts are less randomly angled and more obvious overall now.\u2022 Updated tracers speeds.\u2022 r_drawtracers_firstperson is now visible and archived and fixed.\u2022 Smoke grenade effect now has reduced draw order issues.\u2022 Smoke grenade effect no longer has a great disparity between the screen fog effect and the world fog sprites.\u2022 Reduced the length of time the particle smoke/dust lasts after an HE grenade explodes.\u2022 C4 explosions now have a core explosion that happens right at the bomb itself (so it doesn't look odd when you are spectating or defusing it when it goes off)\u2022 Spectators and observers now have a significant reduction in flashbang effect done to them.General Bug Fixes:\u2022 Fixed player interrupting another player defusing the bomb by walking in front of them.\u2022 Fixed player names running too long in the call vote kick player panel.\u2022 Fixed a bug in Arms Race where switching teams put a bot in the Spectator team.\u2022 The G3SG1 model now has the safety switch set to 'F'.\u2022 The Galil AR model no longer has the light burn on the side plate.\u2022 Fixed issue that let the player crouch and slide around with C4.\u2022 Fixed the penetration code checking a minimum distance of 2 feet after the first impact for the next impact to happen (this fixes surfaces getting ignored if the first wall penetrated was less than 2 feet think - which is pretty common) -- The material blockbullets_cs now completely blocks bullets regardless of penetration. -- Maximum penetration distance has been reduced from 10.6 feet to 4 feet.\u2022 Fixed a bug in Demolition mode where bonus grenade rewards were being called out as achieved but not always given.\u2022 Fix for bug where a spectated player with the AUG/SSG zooms in, the spectator sees the muzzle of the weapon.\u2022 Fix for z-fighting on Phoenix arms at the wrist on the left side that occurs when carrying the knife and looking directly upwards.\u2022 Fixed the radio \"!\" showing up above your own head when you issued a radio command - still shows over other players/bots heads. -- Adjusted color of the overhead \"!\" radio icon to match the HUD scheme.\u2022 Restricting 'The Cleaner' and 'Ballistic' achievements to classic mode. Updated description strings to reflect that.\u2022 Restricting 'Friendly Firearms' achievement to classic modes.\u2022 Restricting 'Base Scamper' to Arms Race mode.\u2022 Fixed incorrect Arms Race achievement descriptions.\u2022 Fixed a message displaying that you can't plant bomb if you had the C4 selected and used anything (door, etc).\u2022 Fixed the C4 button press beeps continuing to play if you started arming the bomb and got killed.\u2022 Fixed the bad max value for zoom sensitivity in the options screen.\u2022 Removed the custom bind for the Zeus in the options screen.  Moved knife/Zeus bind down with the rest of the specific item binds.\u2022 Warmup mode will no longer happen in an offline match now.\u2022 The game won\u2019t ignore spectators when deciding to end the Warmup round.\u2022 Fixed the Demolition gun progression panel not showing up if you were controlling a bot at the end of the round.  Also fixed the progress displaying incorrectly.\u2022 Clicking on the slider bars in the options screens will now change the slider value as expected. \u2022 Fixed a button/popup conflict occurring upon selecting \"Restore Defaults\" option.\u2022 Fixed the audio reset option not persisting.\u2022 Fixed a bug where exiting the video settings screen applies your changes even if you click \"no\".\u2022 Fixed a bug where mouse dragging on an option menu slide control resulted in the control being highlighted but not responding to left and right keyboard commands.\u2022 Fixed a bug where it was impossible to apply settings changes in options menus using controller.\u2022 Fix for first person view weapon not showing up when spectating in Arms Race.\u2022 Fix for Safehouse and Shorttrain Map Veteran Medals not working.\u2022 Fixed revenge count achievement not progressing in Demolition mode.\u2022 Fixed a case where the Arms Race message, \"Alert - You are the new leader\" was displaying in Demolition mode.  \u2022 Fix for the Friendly Firearms Achievement being unattainable.  It could not be unlocked if the weapon was not purchased that round.  Now the game tracks the prior team ownership when a weapon is dropped. This enables the game to know if a weapon was ever owned by a given team. This value is now used to determine if and when a kill is made with a weapon that once belonged to the killed player's team.\u2022 Fix for friendly fire messages not including the (BOT) prefix.\u2022 Arms Race now shows the correct next weapon when you start a new game.\u2022 Fixed case where if your vote failed previously, you wouldn\u2019t get the vote button strings on the next vote cast by another player.\u2022 Fixed potential bug where some players wouldn't get a voting dialog panel when others cast a vote.\u2022 Fixed the Taser range to target indicator where the reticule changing from Green to Red didn\u2019t match the actual range of the Taser.\u2022 Fixed losing mouse focus when in the Achievements menu while a map change occurs.\u2022 Fixed the Radar line of sight being unaffected by doors.\u2022 Fixed the player being unable to see the radar icon for the bomb they dropped if they took over a bot.\u2022 When scrambling teams during Demolition Mode gameplay, we now reset the game data when the round restarts.\u2022 Fixed third person weapons not animating. \u2022 A fix was made to ensure the [E] Takeover Bot navigation hint is not displayed on the spectator menu inappropriately.  It was shown when you changed teams mid round, even though you couldn't actually take over the bot.\u2022 Fixed a performance issue caused by changelevel being invoked twice after a change level vote.\u2022 Fixed a crash that would allow a server operator to crash clients with bad vote commands.\u2022 Fix for the vote UI not sorting to the background when the user opens the buy menu. \u2022 Fix for the Call Vote popup disabling the Left and Right arrow keys.\u2022 Fix for the Voting UI putting mouse focus back to the game while team select screen is open.\u2022 Fix for not being able to vote while the achievements screen is up.\u2022 Fix for a scenario where stepping into molotov fire sometimes turns the screen black. Reduced opacity of screen-space smoke effect at the molotov's core from 1.0 to 0.75. -- Also removed some extraneous tings from the molotov explosion and reduced the lifetime on the molotov inferno's embers, which were artificially enlarging the effect's bounding box.\u2022 Fix for bound key picking the wrong grenade.\u2022 Dropped weapons fly slightly more upwards when thrown from a dead player\u2022 Fix for some MVP issues.  The game still disallows controlled bots being the MVP, but players are allowed to be chosen MVP.  This fix displays the player name correctly as well as allowing players to be selected even if they've taken over a bot. -- This also fixes Top Kills being broken when you take over a bot.\u2022 Hostages break glass that they touch now. This fixes hostages in cs_office getting stuck trying to run through the big panes of glass sometimes.\u2022 Tightened tolerance for CSBots to defuse the bomb. Fixes edge cases where bots think they are close enough to defuse, but are not so they stand there like zombies.\u2022 Fixed the ragdoll force being too high.\u2022 Fixed the Buy Menu inventory not being populated or correct when you first open the buy menu.\u2022 Fixed the preview panel in the Buy Menu not showing preview data (can buy, owned, etc)\u2022 Disallowing five achievements in Arms Race because they did not make sense or were too easy to unlock for that game mode.\u2022 Fixed a bug where your inventory display wouldn't get updated properly in some cases when you took over a bot.\u2022 Fixed a bug where a bot was issuing the wrong radio commands after the new radio code implementation.\u2022 The game will no longer show a \"Game Commencing\" message when the game starts.\u2022 Fixed a bug where last known nav area could stay permanently NULL due to a bad traceline on displacement terrain. We now trace from the player's WorldSpaceCenter() downwards instead of their GetAbsOrigin() (their feet).\u2022 Fixed bug with CNavMesh::GetNavArea() that would return NULL if a nav area was below the ground at all. It now allows for StepHeight (18 unit) tolerance below ground. This was causing CSBots to sometimes go \"zombie\" and stop moving, particularly at spawn at round restart.\u2022 The game no longer shows \"Rounds Left\" in the scoreboard when playing Arms Race. \u2022 Fixed the game mode label having a \" - \" in the Scoreboard.\u2022 Fix for bug in de_train where shooting while strafing + crouching on the green dumpster prop causes unintended behavior.\u2022 Fix for errors and warnings console spew in de_inferno.\u2022 Fix a race condition in the main menu animation if you enter a submenu and immediately cancel out of it while the main menu is still closing\u2022 Fixed case where the earned Achievements in the Win Panel wouldn\u2019t clear their images so if you earned multiple Achievements in one round and only one in the next, the ones you earned in the last round would still show on the panel.\u2022 Fixed a memory overrun when a second controller was connected.\u2022 Fixed 'One Shot One Kill' awarding based on second bullet kills.\u2022 Changed 'Medalist' to award after 100 medals instead of requiring 100% completion.\u2022 Fix for a bug where pulling the network cable on your PC while ingame eventually triggers Steam signout, taking you back to the main menu.\u2022 Fixed issue where we were displaying the raw map name before transitioning to it when the match ended.  This was also fixed in the vote panel.\u2022 Fixed HE Grenade/ molotov not recording kill stats.\u2022 Fixed linux DS crash - for pc, we show the raw map name in the chat when we announce the next map just like we used to because we can't assume we know that map name has a localized token.\u2022 Fixed logic bug that would not correctly cancel-out splashes when the player was running. \u2022 Fix for duplicate game instructor messages displaying when rescuing the hostages.\u2022 Fix for target ID over a player displaying default \"target area\" text.\u2022 Fixed the thin lines showing on the target IDs before the first time they were filled in.\u2022 Changed \u201cWar Bonds\u201d Achievement to $50,000 earned.\u2022 Fix for bug where user is spectating through the POV of a recently disconnected/quit player, they will be able to see out of world once their character despawns.\u2022 Fix for a bug where opening the Scoreboard while in the Choose Team screen shows a camera view of the map floor.\u2022 Update to Awards screen to fix confusing flashing awards.\u2022 Fixed vote success panels showing bad result data if a vote was cast for the other team only.\u2022 Fixed slow orbiting camera movement when using a controller in 3rd person spectator camera view.\u2022 Fixed a performance taxing bug where some icons were getting destroyed and recreated each frame if you were a terrorist on a hostage map.\u2022 Fix for auto-disconnect message in the HUD going away permanently when the game is paused.\u2022 Fix for player being unable to hear knife deployment sounds when deploying the knife while standing on certain properties.\u2022 Fix for deploy sound for knife not playing when secondary weapon is dropped.\u2022 Fixed a bug where a player would connect late to a dedicated server when the warmup period was already in progress but wouldn't see the warmup panel at the top of the screen. \u2022 Fix for voting failing with 6/10 simple majority.\u2022 Fix for the Current World Ranking leaderboard mouse over region for individual rows being too large. This caused the incorrect row to be selected while clicking or moving the mouse around the screen.\u2022 Fixed bots exclaiming at the start of a round whatever state they were last experiencing when they died or at the end of the previous round.\u2022 Fixed a bug where the player was able to switch teams over and over and take control of bots in a game session on a dedicated server.\u2022 Fix for a bug where a hostage appeared illuminated on the radar after it was killed.\u2022 Fix for incorrect game settings description displayed in loading screen when connecting to a map.\u2022 Fix for bug where bot takeover in the middle of a grenade throw results in an extra grenade.\u2022 Fixed two edge-case crashes for bot takeover when the bot has no weapons.\u2022 Fix for bug where throwing grenades on certain slopes will result in them slowly skittering down the slope rather than coming to rest and exploding.\u2022 Fix for a bug that made it possible to throw smoke grenades in such a way that teammates can enter the smoke radius without seeing or hearing the smoke, completely immune to its effect.\u2022 Fixed the brightness value slider showing values from highest to lowest.\u2022 Fixed SECOND and SECONDS in the \"match is restarting\" alert being hard-coded and not localized.\u2022 Reworded the description of \"First Things First\" and \"Target Secured\" Achievements to match what the code expects you to do to achieve it as they were perceived as unawardable.\u2022 Fix for scenario in Demolition mode where after killing an opponent the bonus grenade pop up or next gun pop up will block the user's reticle hindering aiming.\u2022 Fixed bomb planted instructor hints showing up for a frame and then going away most of the time.\u2022 Removed account balance requirement from the \u201cKillanthropist\u201d Achievement criteria.\u2022 Fixed new modulated decal art not having enough contrast to make it work with the modulation shader and made a bunch of decals really hard to see.\u2022 Fixed cl_spec_mode not saving the player preference so it always reset you to the default spec option.\u2022 First person spectator is now the default for all modes.\u2022 Fixed throwing weapons landing too short or too high.\u2022 Fixed case where if the viewmodel gun barrel traced through a solid object on its way to the impact point, the tracer would interpenetrate that object and make shooting feel off or fake.\u2022 Fixed dlight muzzle flash being in the wrong spot (the attachment points on viewmodel never return the proper world position).\u2022 Fixed the Scoreboard delay that prevented fast toggling.\u2022 Fixed the Scoreboard getting stuck in a toggle state if you weren\u2019t alive.\u2022 Fixed the whole screen going blurry when the bomb exploded if you were not killed by that bomb.\u2022 Fixed HUD scaling getting stomped by the play distance convars (which aren't used anymore).\u2022 Fixed the cl_showloadout convar not getting respected if it wasn't actually toggled in that session.\u2022 Flashbangs now make a scorch on the ground to show where it went off.\u2022 Dropping the connection to Steam shouldn't drop you to front end on PC/Mac, whether you're in an offline or online game now.\u2022 Dedicated server now sends mapgroupname so the client has the proper mapgroupname to send back to DS.\u2022 Setting your sound configs to default now sets your speaker option to the optimal setting based on what windows is set to.\u2022 Fix for when a player is locked into a controller on pc not being able to use the chat.\u2022 Fixed right edge of death message sticking off end of the safe area.\u2022 Fixed regression that was preventing Achievements from being announced in the chat channel.\u2022 Fix for the background around chat not accommodating very long lines of text.\u2022 Fix for CT bots in Lake standing on the kitchen counter, attempting and failing to go through a window.\u2022 Fix for bots in Train getting stuck on a ladder.\u2022 Fix for bots in Nuke jumping on crates for many seconds.\u2022 Fix for the game instructor \"plant bomb\" hint being displayed twice in bombsite B of Train. \u2022 Fix for a bug in the Buy Menu where the first time the buy menu is opened, all categories are grey (indicating available) when some items should be red to indicate that they are not affordable at that time.\u2022 Removing this convar [ CSGO - sv_allow_lobby_connect_only ]  for CSGO build, since we would like lobbies to always be associated with servers for community matchmaking.\u2022 Removed setting of maxplayers before every session.\u2022 Disabled maxplayers command, server now sets min/max/default maxplayers based on server.dll\u2022 The game now forces extra spectator slots to 2.\u2022 Kick a bot that a player is controlling now reverts the player to essentially display as alive. However, their stats still do not change until they are alive again properly\u2022 Better logging info when a file fails the sv_pure check.\u2022 Added support for the chat to use the same rules for chat visibility as is used for voice audibility.\u2022 Disabled mode-based restrictions on showing Elo rank in scoreboard.\u2022 Fix for vote UI having incorrect maps listed if the server runs custom map groups.\u2022 Fixed some HUD elements not getting scaled properly.\u2022 Play With Friends update: -- Hooked up Steam page button. -- Made mouse click get correct IDs for Invite and Join states. -- Made Join states show correctly. -- Removed team play option. -- Fixed the toggle for Private / Public option. -- Fix for the Kick player function. -- Kick now shows the correct \u2018kicked\u2019 text string.\u2022 Fixed an issue where tracers were coming from the wrong spot when spectating.\u2022 Now return correct number of max human players for server browser and master servers.Matchmaking:\u2022 Added a convar:mm_session_search_distance which allows us to bump session search distance to be able to find lobbies on Steam Beta (set to >=1).\u2022 Fixed the search to not use -1 for numSlots, to not use a filter on numSlots and to not use bypasslobby, but rather use game state filter.\u2022 Fixed dedicated server reporting numSlots no greater than 16 even when running PC casual with 20 slots, will still need to do client-side work to not stomp that value.\u2022 Fixed a bug where Korean characters could not be typed in chat.\u2022 Fixed several bugs with session slots: --  When transitioning from PWF lobby to an official dedicated server we increase members limit to 20. --  Dedicated servers now report numSlots representing max human players\u2022 Session created based on information from direct connect to community server will now preserve number of slots defined by the community server.\u2022 Fixed a memory leak for searches that produce no results from play with friends.

Play with friends now finds a dedicated server for public game correctly.Community Support\u2022 Added a callback into server.dll that can send client messages before engine advances sign on state to connected state. This lets server to pass data to client before client starts loading map and precaching models.\u2022 CSGO will send information about viewmodels and player models, max players and maplist down to clients since clients do not necessarily have info about mapgroup and map played by the server.\u2022 Community quick play search will no longer attempt to create a new lobby if it fails to find an existing lobby to join.Known issue: - Mini scoreboard occasionally shows the wrong number of players.\t\t\n"

This allows clients to actually download map since resources are referenced by strings and the client will not have the dictionary until they have the map.\u2022 Client will defer .bsp file preload until after required resources are available. For the case of a missing map, this allows the client to reach signon state \"new\" and kick off downloader thread while retaining their spot on the server.

The CT's incendiary grenade remains $850.  - Note that the pistol arrangement has changed in the buymenu.- The messaging system has been converted to protobuf.  - Demos recorded with previous versions of CS:GO will not be compatible as of this update. In order to view old demos, set your 'beta' to 'demo_viewer' in the CS:GO betas property panel, in Steam. Don't forget to set it back to 'NONE' when you want to play online again.  - If you are running SourceMod on your server, you will need to update to the latest version. For details, see: http://www.sourcemod.net/index.php[ MINOR CHANGES ]- Added some performance improvements for low-end clients.- Fixed some fence materials that were allowing players to see through smoke grenades.- GOTV spectator UI will now correctly show kevlar and helmet information for players.- Avatars will now correctly load for all players when connected to a GOTV server or when watching a demo.- Added support to notify players during servers maintenance downtime.- Fixed a dedicated server exploit where community dedicated servers could masquerade as official and get players searching for official game modes connected to them (saigns.de)- Fixed a rare problem when clients matchmaking for Classic Competitive game could be stuck on green Accept screen- Fixed a rare problem when clients could connect to a Classic Competitive game and then later be disconnected for failing to accept the match.- Improved algorithm pinging whitelisted dedicated servers when searching for Classic Competitive games, pinging less addresses fixes occasional problems for some customers where address translation tables on their routers would fill up and their routers would fail to route required packets to display the green Accept screen.- Added support for mm_dedicated_search_maxping to restrict client's ping when matchmaking for Classic Competitive games. ( Matchmaking algorithm will still be prioritizing best servers to minimize ping of all party members. )- Fixed a rare server crash when bots attempted to shoot the bomb defuser.- Fixed a client crash when downloading a lot of custom assets from community servers.[ NOTES TO MAPMAKERS ]- DEATHMATCH:  - Deathmatch uses the nav mesh to create spawn points. Make sure that your nav is contained within the bounds of your map to ensure that players aren't spawned outside of it. Use map_showspawnpoints to see where spawn points were generated.  - If you want to use mapper-placed spawnpoints instead of the randomly generated ones, place an info_map_parameters in your map and set usenormalspawnsfordm (\"Use Normal Spawns in Deathmatch?) to true.- WORKSHOP:  - We're launching the private beta for workshop maps. If you're a map maker, mail csgo_sdk@list.valvesoftware.com with the subject \"Map Workshop Beta\" and your steam id in the content, with a link to maps shipped ( or maps in progress ) suitable for the Workshop.- Please use the CSGO SDK list for discussions about Deathmatch and Workshop.Thanks.\t\t\n"

        "entry": "\nRelease Notes for 6/19/2017 Beta 1\n2017.06.19   - \n[ GOTV ]\nThis build contains significant changes in the game server and GOTV network delta packets processing to allow running two GOTV server instances with different delays, to allow correcting cameraman shots using a spectator connected to a small delay TV, and airing corrected shots on the longer delay TV. This client build is compatible with regular public 1.35.8.9 game servers.\nNew settings for the game server:\ntv_delay1 allows to set a custom delay on TV1 server, with the developed scenario having TV1 delay be at least 3 seconds, and not more than TV0 delay configured with tv_delay setting.\ntv_allow_camera_man_steamid2 allows configuring an additional interactive caster account, with the developed scenario connecting the main caster as a live spectator on the game server directly, and the additional interactive caster connect to TV1 server with a small delay.\ntv_challenge_steam_iprange allows configuring a set of comma-separated IP ranges, clients connecting from those IP addresses will go through full Steam authentication even for GOTV connections, which is necessary for additional interactive caster authentication.\nNew settings for the game client:\ncameraman_override setting controls when additional interactive caster camera is used to override the primary caster. Setting cameraman_override 1 on the additional interactive caster connected to TV1 will start overriding the primary interactive caster from the moment this setting is enabled in small delay TV timeline, and setting cameraman_override 0 will stop the override at the moment this command is issued in small delay TV timeline. With cameraman_override set to 1, the camera position of the additional interactive caster is transmitted to the TV1 server and overrides camera positions of the primary interactive caster. Consumers of TV0 GOTV data delayed enough for the overrides to take place will be receiving corrected camera positions.\ncl_cameraman_override_messages setting controls whether UI message is displayed in spectate panel to indicate that the camera override is taking place. UI message can be disabled by setting cl_cameraman_override_messages 0.\nDeveloped example scenario:\nServer is configured with tv_delay1 3 seconds, and tv_delay 10 seconds, both TV0 and TV1 servers are active and additional interactive caster account connected to TV1 server.\nPlayers X and Y on one team playing against players U and V on another team, players X and U go towards bombsite A, players Y and V go towards bombsite B. There\u2019s no camera that main caster account can select to keep all players in view, so they select to broadcast POV of player X approaching bombsite A. When the round clock in the live game shows 0:56 player V unexpectedly eliminates player Y, and that action wasn\u2019t observed by the main caster.\nAt this point, our additional interactive caster connected to a 3 second delay server still has their round clock showing 0:59 and all players alive. Additional interactive caster switches their camera POV to player V to broadcast the shot and executes their bind to set cameraman_override 1. Alternatively additional interactive caster can switch to in-eye POV of player Y who is still alive at 0:59 but will be eliminated shortly and execute their bind to set cameraman_override 1.\nWhen TV1 round clock reaches 0:50, additional interactive caster may decide to relinquish broadcast control to the main live cameraman and should then execute their bind to set cameraman_override 0.\nBroadcast for viewers connected to the 10 seconds delayed TV0, broadcast for viewers watching GOTV+ HTTP stream from TV0, and the GOTV demo file recorded on TV0, will contain POV of player X until 0:59, then selected camera shot of player V eliminating player Y until 0:53, and then continued POV of player X. Neither GOTV broadcast, nor GOTV demo file, will have additional interactive caster\u2019s SteamID recorded, and the data should be seamless on the client, just as if the main caster could have switched to different broadcast POVs at 0:59 and 0:53 round clock times.\nAlternatively, entire broadcast can be performed with the additional interactive caster on TV1 having cameraman_override 1, controlling camera POV all the time and never relinquishing control to the live interactive caster, while still being able to get information from live game either on the screen of live interactive caster or from game state integration data pushed from live interactive caster session. Keep in mind however that commentary sound is always recorded live from the main interactive caster voice channel and is not modified by additional interactive caster.\n\nTweet\n \u00a0 \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n"

Eventually we intend to turn this feature on for all users, but at the moment it can be controlled by the convar \u2018snd_occlusion\u2019.

Pearlescent coatings use ceramic crystals to reflect and refract light, splitting it into different colors as the view angle changes. This effect can be used in a number of ways to subtly enhance your weapon finish or make drastic changes. The new Operation Shattered Web collections have some weapons with pearlescent coatings to illustrate some of the ways this new feature can be used. The Workshop Workbench has been updated to include this feature so you can experiment with adding this coating to a weapon finish. Using higher values will make the color bands tighter and more frequent and using negative values will flip the spectrum to start on the opposite end. It should be noted that this coating will shift the hue of your weapon finish so parts with no saturation, and therefore no hue, will have no pearlescent effect. We look forward to seeing what interesting applications you come up with.\n[ MAPS ]\n\u2013 Added Studio to Scrimmage and Casual Sigma map groups.\n\u2013 Added Jungle to the Danger Zone rotation.\n\u2013 Added Lunacy to Flying Scoutsman\n\u2013 Zoo and Seaside have been removed.\nCache:\n\u2013 Cache has been moved from Scrimmage to Competitive Matchmaking\nVertigo:\n\u2013 Added ramp to final stage of scaffolding on A ramp, no longer need to jump up\n\u2013 Connected corridor to back of A with CT elevator room\n\u2013 Widened top of mid\n\u2013 Offset doors from CT spawn and to CT elevator room\n\u2013 Made A site CT death funnel shorter, widened site area\n\u2013 Removed big block in CT spawn\n\u2013 Moved A ramp sandbags to allow jump up\n\u2013 Various bug and clipping fixes\n\nTweet\n \u00a0 \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n"
