Texture streaming allows the game to defer loading of high-resolution textures until they are needed for rendering, potentially saving a significant amount of video memory.

Pearlescent coatings use ceramic crystals to reflect and refract light, splitting it into different colors as the view angle changes. This effect can be used in a number of ways to subtly enhance your weapon finish or make drastic changes. The new Operation Shattered Web collections have some weapons with pearlescent coatings to illustrate some of the ways this new feature can be used. The Workshop Workbench has been updated to include this feature so you can experiment with adding this coating to a weapon finish. Using higher values will make the color bands tighter and more frequent and using negative values will flip the spectrum to start on the opposite end. It should be noted that this coating will shift the hue of your weapon finish so parts with no saturation, and therefore no hue, will have no pearlescent effect. We look forward to seeing what interesting applications you come up with.\n[ MAPS ]\n\u2013 Added Studio to Scrimmage and Casual Sigma map groups.\n\u2013 Added Jungle to the Danger Zone rotation.\n\u2013 Added Lunacy to Flying Scoutsman\n\u2013 Zoo and Seaside have been removed.\nCache:\n\u2013 Cache has been moved from Scrimmage to Competitive Matchmaking\nVertigo:\n\u2013 Added ramp to final stage of scaffolding on A ramp, no longer need to jump up\n\u2013 Connected corridor to back of A with CT elevator room\n\u2013 Widened top of mid\n\u2013 Offset doors from CT spawn and to CT elevator room\n\u2013 Made A site CT death funnel shorter, widened site area\n\u2013 Removed big block in CT spawn\n\u2013 Moved A ramp sandbags to allow jump up\n\u2013 Various bug and clipping fixes\n\nTweet\n \u00a0 \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n"

        "entry": "\nRelease Notes for 6/19/2017 Beta 1\n2017.06.19   - \n[ GOTV ]\nThis build contains significant changes in the game server and GOTV network delta packets processing to allow running two GOTV server instances with different delays, to allow correcting cameraman shots using a spectator connected to a small delay TV, and airing corrected shots on the longer delay TV. This client build is compatible with regular public 1.35.8.9 game servers.\nNew settings for the game server:\ntv_delay1 allows to set a custom delay on TV1 server, with the developed scenario having TV1 delay be at least 3 seconds, and not more than TV0 delay configured with tv_delay setting.\ntv_allow_camera_man_steamid2 allows configuring an additional interactive caster account, with the developed scenario connecting the main caster as a live spectator on the game server directly, and the additional interactive caster connect to TV1 server with a small delay.\ntv_challenge_steam_iprange allows configuring a set of comma-separated IP ranges, clients connecting from those IP addresses will go through full Steam authentication even for GOTV connections, which is necessary for additional interactive caster authentication.\nNew settings for the game client:\ncameraman_override setting controls when additional interactive caster camera is used to override the primary caster. Setting cameraman_override 1 on the additional interactive caster connected to TV1 will start overriding the primary interactive caster from the moment this setting is enabled in small delay TV timeline, and setting cameraman_override 0 will stop the override at the moment this command is issued in small delay TV timeline. With cameraman_override set to 1, the camera position of the additional interactive caster is transmitted to the TV1 server and overrides camera positions of the primary interactive caster. Consumers of TV0 GOTV data delayed enough for the overrides to take place will be receiving corrected camera positions.\ncl_cameraman_override_messages setting controls whether UI message is displayed in spectate panel to indicate that the camera override is taking place. UI message can be disabled by setting cl_cameraman_override_messages 0.\nDeveloped example scenario:\nServer is configured with tv_delay1 3 seconds, and tv_delay 10 seconds, both TV0 and TV1 servers are active and additional interactive caster account connected to TV1 server.\nPlayers X and Y on one team playing against players U and V on another team, players X and U go towards bombsite A, players Y and V go towards bombsite B. There\u2019s no camera that main caster account can select to keep all players in view, so they select to broadcast POV of player X approaching bombsite A. When the round clock in the live game shows 0:56 player V unexpectedly eliminates player Y, and that action wasn\u2019t observed by the main caster.\nAt this point, our additional interactive caster connected to a 3 second delay server still has their round clock showing 0:59 and all players alive. Additional interactive caster switches their camera POV to player V to broadcast the shot and executes their bind to set cameraman_override 1. Alternatively additional interactive caster can switch to in-eye POV of player Y who is still alive at 0:59 but will be eliminated shortly and execute their bind to set cameraman_override 1.\nWhen TV1 round clock reaches 0:50, additional interactive caster may decide to relinquish broadcast control to the main live cameraman and should then execute their bind to set cameraman_override 0.\nBroadcast for viewers connected to the 10 seconds delayed TV0, broadcast for viewers watching GOTV+ HTTP stream from TV0, and the GOTV demo file recorded on TV0, will contain POV of player X until 0:59, then selected camera shot of player V eliminating player Y until 0:53, and then continued POV of player X. Neither GOTV broadcast, nor GOTV demo file, will have additional interactive caster\u2019s SteamID recorded, and the data should be seamless on the client, just as if the main caster could have switched to different broadcast POVs at 0:59 and 0:53 round clock times.\nAlternatively, entire broadcast can be performed with the additional interactive caster on TV1 having cameraman_override 1, controlling camera POV all the time and never relinquishing control to the live interactive caster, while still being able to get information from live game either on the screen of live interactive caster or from game state integration data pushed from live interactive caster session. Keep in mind however that commentary sound is always recorded live from the main interactive caster voice channel and is not modified by additional interactive caster.\n\nTweet\n \u00a0 \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n"

This means that the third-person motion of the player is now represented more accurately from the first-person perspective.\n\u2013 Third-person landing recovery animations are now weighted based on altitude traversed and duration in-air.
